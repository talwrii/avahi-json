Query the local network for devices and services using MDNS via avahi (like `avahi-browser -ar`) but output results in easy-to-use JSON.

## Motivation
I have an Android phone on my home network. I also use KDE connect on the phone. I occassionally want to connect to this phone via ADB over a TCP connection, but the IP address is not fixed.

I could use KDE connect to find the device since KDE connect advertises itself using an MDNS services (i.e. avahi). This would be all well and good - but the avahi command-line tool neither allows me to directly query for my phone, nor does it produce machine-readable output.

Therefore I am writing something which queries for services on the network using avahi and outputs theresult in beautiful JSON. I am slightly surprised that no one has done this before.

## Installation
You must first install the `python3-avahi` bindings. These are handled by `apt` on Ubuntu and can be installed with `sudo apt install python3-avahi`. 

You can then install `avahi-json` itself using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) with the following command (`--system-site-packages` is needed for avahi and dbus):

```
pipx install --system-site-packages avahi-json
```

You need to have avahi, Linux's mdns daemon, installed to use this. But this tends to be installed by default.

## Usage
Run `avahi-json`: this will give you services on the network with a separate JSON entry on each line.
